# User Centric Front end Milestone Project

Welcome to my first front end project, for this project i made a website for the Dj duo called The Chainsmokers to showcase their music, themselves and publicise their availability to perform at events.

## UX

The website will be used by fans and potential fans who wish to  learn more about the dj duo, see and hear video and audio clips of their music and 
any new material as it becomes available.

My project will provide fans and potential fans with information about The Chainsmokers, audio and video clips of their music
and the opportunity to book the duo to perform at events such as weddings and christmas parties.

## User Stories

- As a fan/potential fan, I want to have the ablity to play audio files from the website, so that I can listen to the duo's music.
- As a fan/potential fan, I want to have the ablity to play video files from the website, so that I can watch to the duo's music videos.
- As a fan/potential fan, I want to be notified when new material becomes available, so that I can check out the new material out when it is released.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

    - The project uses **Bootstrap js** for the responsive navigation bar at the top of the page.
- [Popper js](https://popper.js.org/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap js** for the responsive navigation bar at the top of the page.
- [Bootstrap css](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap css** for the bootstrap grid system, forms and image carousel.

## Testing

I have tested the website extensively on all screen sizes. All the audio and video files work. I have tested all the forms included in the website and they all work.

1. Mailing list form:
    1. Go to the "Home" page, "The Guys" page, "Listen" page and "Book" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. Booking form:
    1. Go to the "Book" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

3. Audio files:
    1. Go to the "Listen" page
    2. Click on the play button and the audio files play.

4. Video files:
    1. Go to the "home" page, "The Guys" page and the "listen" page
    2. Click on the play button and the video files play.

My project is completely responsive to all screen sizes. On the "listen" page the audio players are placed underneath an image of the single cover with the track title, for desktop screens these are aligned to the left whilst on mobile screens every other one is aligned to the right creating a pattern.  

## Deployment

I have pushed the repository to GitHub where i have published the site on GitHub Pages. 

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
